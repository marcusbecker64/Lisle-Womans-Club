    <h1>About the Lisle Woman's Club</h1>

<div class = "aboutInfo">
    <div class = "aboutInner">
    The Lisle Woman’s Club, charted in 1963, is affiliated with the General Federation of Woman’s Clubs (GFWC) and the Illinois Federation of Women’s Clubs (GFWC-IL).<br><br>
    The General Federation of Women’s Clubs, one of the world’s largest and oldest nonpartisan, nondenominational women’s volunteer service organizations, was founded in 1890 and chartered by the 56th United States Congress in 1901.<br><br>
    GFWC has a long history of philanthropy, social and political advocacy, and community leadership. More than100,000 members in affiliated clubs in every state and more than a dozen countries work in their own communities to support the arts, preserve natural resources, advance education, promote healthy lifestyles, encourage civic involvement, and work toward world peace and understanding.<br><br>
    GFWC is responsible for the establishment of 75% of America’s public libraries. One of the first major projects of the Lisle Woman’s Club was the creation of a junior public library. It was staffed by LWC volunteers and contained donated books and furniture. The library opened on April 12, 1964, in a rent-free basement room at 4742 Main St. Soon adult books were added to the collection. In February and May in 1964, members took time out from the library activities to help with the Sabin Polio Vaccine Program in Lisle.<br><br>
    LWC, the newly formed Friends of the Lisle Library group, and other organizations and individuals then successfully worked to promote passage of the December 1965 referendum to establish a Lisle Library District.
    Throughout the intervening years, LWC members have devoted countless volunteer hours to philanthropy and community service to benefit our community.
